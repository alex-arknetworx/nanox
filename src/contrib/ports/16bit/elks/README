ELKS (not tested since version 0.86)
====
ELKS users set the line below in the config file.
	ARCH=ELKS

The NWIDGET=N line must be set, as bcc can't handle
ansi C's token paste operator, used in the widget library.

The serial mouse driver is in microwindows/src/drivers/mou_ser.c.
The default mouse port and type can be changed with the following
environment variables, or changed in the driver.

Environment Var		Default		Allowed
MOUSE_TYPE		pc		ms, pc, logi(same as pc)
MOUSE_PORT		/dev/ttys0	any serial port

It might also be a good idea to use the XOR frame-redraw window
move algorithm, by setting the following lines in the config file.
The XOR algorithm redraws only after the window move is
completed, which works well on slower cpu's.
	ERASEMOVE=N
	UPDATEREGIONS=N

Since ELKS doesn't currently have a floating point library,
the 3d demo is automatically compiled out of
microwindows/src/demos/mwin/mwdemo.c:
	#define GRAPH3D	0
	#define IMAGE	0
The IMAGE define is set to 0 as bringing in most
images will break the 64k data segment limit.  The ELKS
version also doesn't include the button control or wallpaper
in the demo to keep the text/data sizes down.

The latest version of the ELKS kernel supports a variant
of UNIX sockets, using numbers rather than names.  To
build a client/server version of Nano-X for ELKS, the config line
	LINK_APP_INTO_SERVER=y
must be set.  In addition, the bcc compiler doesn't support
the ANSI C '##' token pasting operator which is used
in the client request code, client.c.  Run the following
perl script to preprocess the client.c source file:

	cd microwindows/src/nanox
	mv client.c client.dist
	./elkspatch.pl < client.dist > client.c
