These are some test routines using AGG Lite rendering and an AdaFruit compatible
GFX library implementation for much nicer round rects and circles for embedded devices.

These routines run directly on the engine layer and don't use the NX or win32/mwin APIs.
I hope to get further along in another revision and add the round rect and circle
routines into microwindows main draw routines, as well as experiment with float coordinates.
