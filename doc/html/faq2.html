<h1>Microwindows Frequently Asked Questions - Part 2</h1>

<p>August 3, 2019 Microwindows FAQ2<br>
<br>
</p>

<h3>How to install Microwindows?</h3>

<p>Download the current version of Microwindows from GitHub.<br>
Read the instructions in microwindows/src/README.
<br>

<h3>What do the different directories contain?</h3>
Here is an overview of the directory structure in the main "src" directory:
<pre>
bin:		compiled executables
Configs:	"config" file examples for different platforms, see Configs/README
contrib:	user contributed, TinyWidgets and alternative Makefile_nr make system for EMSCRIPTEN, Android and DJGPP
demoscripts:	outdated example scripts to execute demos. Use ./runapp instead, see src/README.
docs:		programming notes
drivers:	source code of the screen, mouse and screen device drivers
ecos:		special files for the ECOS operating system
engine:		source code for Microwindows graphics drawing and clipping engine
fonts:		fonts required for demo programs
include:	header files
lib:		compiled libraries
mwin:		source code for the Win32 API implementation
nanox:		source code for the Nano-X API implementation
nx11:		source code for the NX11 X11 compatibility library
obj:		temporary object files
rtems:		special files for the RTEMS operating system
</pre>
<p>


<h3>Where is the configure file?</h3>

<p>Microwindows does not have a configure file, but uses a "config" file which is read
by the automatic makefile system.  To customise<br>
this for the various platforms there is a config file which you can edit. Examples of this<br>
config file for different platforms are in the "src/Configs" directory.<br>
<br>

For Android, MingGW and DJGPP platforms there are currently additional special makefiles,<br>
and Makefile_nr is used.<br>
<br>

The Makefile, which is used for Linux and OSX includes Path.rules and the config file<br>
mentioned above. Then it includes the Makefile.rules file which contains the clean and install <br>
targets for Make and calls the Makefiles in the subdirectories. It also includes Arch.rules which <br>
contains handling settings for the different platforms supported. The Makefiles in the subdirectories<br>
will also include the Path.rules file, the config file plus Objects.rules files. They call the<br>
Makefile.rules file again to compile the required files.<br>
<br>
<br>
</p>

<h3>What is the NX11 library?</h3>

<p>Since nano-X was not designed to be fully compatible with X11 it used to be quite some work to port X11 applications to<br>
nano-X. NX11 is a wrapper library for nano-X which provides X11 compatibility.<br>
<br>
Users of Microwindows may want to port X11 applications to it.
These applications will be linked with NX11 instead of
X11 directly. Many applications now are not based on X11 directly but using a GUI toolkit.
A lightweight library is FLTK which can be based well on NX11.<br>
<br>
If you link an application with libNX11 you also have to link it with libnano-X, i.e. -lNX11 and -lnano-X.<br>
<br>
Before this release NX11 was called NXlib, and was a separate archive to download. It now is included in the src/nx11 subdirectory in the Microwindows sources.<br>
<br>
To compile the NX11 library, pick a config file that matches your target system from microwindows/src/Configs,
and copy it to microwindows/src/config. Then, set the following options and type "make".<br>
<br>
NANOX=Y		(build nano-X library and server)<br>
NX11=Y		(builds NX11 library)<br>
NANOWM=Y	(include built-in window manager in nano-X server)<br>
NUKLEARUI=N	(use older-style window frames, better match for FLTK graphics)<br>
<br>
</p>

<h3>How to compile a program using the Nano-X or NX11 libraries on the command line?</h3>
Nano-X:<br>
<br>
First make e.g. a "mytests" folder in the "microwindows/src" directory. Copy e.g. the "src/demos/nanox/arcdemo.c" program<br>
into the "mytests" folder. Then, while in the "src" folder, enter:<br>
<br>
"gcc -Llib -Iinclude mytests/arcdemo.c -lnano-X -o mytests/arcdemo"<br>
<br>
This will compile the arcdemo program in the mytests folder. To run the program enter, while in the "src" directory,<br> 
the following line:<br>
<br>
"bin/nano-X -N & mytests/arcdemo"<br>
<br>
NX11:<br>
<br>
If you compiled shared libraries, which is the default setting in the config file, you may have to execute the<br>
command "sudo make install" so the applications using NX11 will find the required libraries they depend on.<br>
Otherwise on Linux, you will need a compiler option to set the shared library path to the microwindows lib directory.
<br>
To use the NX11 library copy e.g. the "src/nxlib/test/xgreen.c" program into the "mytests" folder. <br>
Then, while in the "src" folder, enter:<br>
<br>
"gcc -Llib -Iinclude mytests/xgreen.c -lNX11 -lnano-X -o mytests/xgreen"<br>
<br>
This will compile the xgreen program in the mytests folder. To run the program enter, while in the "src" directory, <br> 
the following line:<br>
<br>
"bin/nano-X -N & mytests/xgreen"<br>
<br>
</p>


<h3>How to compile FLTK for Microwindows?</h3>

<p>For this you have to compile Microwindows first for your particular system. In the Configs directory there are<br>
example config files for various platforms. Rename the config file in the src directory to e.g. config.default <br>
and copy the config file which fits your system into the src directory. E.g. "cp Configs/config.linux-X11 config".<br>
<br>
In the config file, check that the path for the freetype2 headers is properly defined in the INCFT2LIB variable.<br>
The default is set to "/usr/include". In this case the Makefile.rules file will add "freetype2" to this path so<br>
this results in the path "/usr/include/freetype2". You can also specify "/usr/include/freetype2" or some other path<br>
instead. When using the X11 platform, leave SHAREDLIBS=Y and LINK_APP_INTO_SERVER=N.<br>
<br>
Then compile Microwindows and enter "sudo make install" to install the shared libraries NX11 and nano-X plus<br>
the nano-X server in the "/usr/local" directory so FLTK can access them there.<br>
You can remove these again with the "sudo make cleanusr" command.<br>
The following instructions are in sequence for the various versions of FLTK. Please refer to the bottom of this <br>
section to compile the latest version.<br>
<p>
Download <b>FLTK 1.3.2</b> and cd into the fltk directory. If you are using a later version, you have to follow the<br>
additional instructions provided below. Then enter:<br>
<pre>
./configure --x-includes=/path/to/microwindows/src/nx11/X11-local/X11 \
  --x-libraries=/path/to/microwindows/src/lib \
  --disable-gl \
  --disable-xinerama \
  --disable-xft  \
  --disable-xdbe \
  --disable-xfixes
</pre>
Modify the paths specified to match your situation. You can put this command into a script to repeat it if <br>
required.<br>
<br>
Then replace the "-lX11 and -lXext" entries with "-lNX11 -lnano-X" in the files makeinclude <br>
and fltk-config. You can use the replace-lX11.sh script in the microwindows/src/nx11 directory for that. You can<br>
run that script once with makeinclude entered on the command line and once with fltk-config specified <br>
on the command line:<br>
<pre>
replace-lX11.sh makeinclude
replace-lX11.sh fltk-config
</pre>
If you are using Microwindows on the Linux X11 platform, you will need to make a patch to the FLTK source code<br>
since FLTK will dynamically load XRANDR support when starting and that causes your program to crash immediately.<br>
So open the file "src/Fl_x.cxx" and add the line "#undef USE_XRANDR" right after the line<br>
"#define USE_XRANDR (HAVE_DLSYM && HAVE_DLFCN_H)" which currently is line 51. This will avoid that XRANDR support<br>
will be loaded.<br>
<br>
Then enter "make" in the fltk directory. <br> 
<br>
After that you can execute the examples using a script like that: "nano-X & test/hello".<br>
On some platforms these commands do not work from the command line, just from a script. After terminating the <br>
application you have to terminate this script with CTRL-C. Sometimes the application window hides behind other windows.<br>
As an alternative you can also start each program in this script separately on the command line like that:
<pre>
nano-X&
test/hello
</pre>
This way the programs nano-X and nanowm will continue to run in the background and you can execute different demos<br>
sequentially. The nano-X server can be run with the "-p" persistent option which will stop it from exiting when the last NX11 application exits.<br>
<br>
If you run the examples, however, you will find that the fonts do not work. You just get the small default font.<br>
To enable truetype fonts you can either copy the fonts.alias file example from the "src/nxlib/fonts" directory<br> 
into the truetype directory into e.g. "/usr/share/fonts/truetype" using sudo. Or you change the selected fonts<br>
from FLTK by modifying the font names in the file "fltk-1.3.2/src/fl_font_x.cxx" if you are comfortable with<br>
XLFD descriptions. There is also the TTFONTS environment variable which points Microwindows to the truetype fonts<br>
directory.<br>
<br>
If you want to compile a program from the command line you can enter:<br> 
"g++ test/hello.cxx -o hello -Llib  -lNX11 -lnano-X -lfreetype -lfltk -ldl"<br>
If you do not need to compile fluid and the demos you can "cd" into the "fltk-1.3.2/src" directory and enter "make" there.<br>
This will just compile the FLTK libraries.<br>
<br>
The instructions above assumed that the Microwindows libraries were compiled as shared libraries. You can also use<br>
static libraries. In this case you have to set SHAREDLIBS=N in the "config" file and compile Microwindows with this <br>
parameter set. Then enter "sudo make install". In the "makeinclude" file in the FLTK directory you have to specify<br>
the path to the static library instead of "-lNX11": "/path/to/microwindows/src/lib/libNX11.a". Modify the path to your<br>
situation. Also, behind the -lNX11 parameter in "makeinclude" you may have to add "-lfreetype" to get FLTK to compile using the<br>
static library. Then enter "make".<br>
If you enter "make -k" it will not stop when trying to compile the sudoku game. It may stop at the UTF-8 program,<br>
but the examples and FLTK will work anyway.<br>
<br>
Again, you can then execute the demos using this script: "nano-X & test/hello &"<br>
<br>
If you are <b>not</b> using the X11 platform and have set SHAREDLIBS=N plus LINK_APP_INTO_SERVER=Y in the microwindows<br>
config file, you can start the examples without a script and just enter "test/hello" on the command line. Or click on the<br>
program in your file explorer.<br>
<br>
Since FLTK does not need PNG or JPEG support by Microwindows, you can disable these in the "config" file before<br>
compiling Microwindows. You can disable all fonts except FREETYPE2 also.<br>
<br>
If you port Microwindows to a platform without ZLIB, PNG or JPEG libraries, FLTK will compile its own support for this. <br>
In that case you can add the following additional parameters when running "configure" in the FLTK directory:<br>
<pre>
  --enable-localjpeg \
  --enable-localpng \
  --enable-localzlib \
  --disable-threads \
</pre>
<br>
If you are using <b>FLTK 1.3.3</b> and want to use the native file chooser you will now have to patch the file:<br>
"src/Fl_Native_File_Chooser_FLTK.cxx". This because Microwindows does provide a GTK file chooser.<br>
<br>
In this source file add the following two lines right at the beginning of the "Fl_GTK_File_Chooser::probe_for_GTK_libs()" function:<br>
<pre>
    did_find_GTK_libs = 0;
    return;
</pre>
<br>
If you are using <b>FLTK 1.3.4</b> you have to put "#undef USE_XRANDR" into the "screen_xywh.cxx" file too. Add this<br> 
line right after the line "#define USE_XRANDR (HAVE_DLSYM && HAVE_DLFCN_H)". Here you you have to put it right after<br> 
line 159 where USE_XRANDR is defined. For this version you also have to add the following lines to the configure command:<br>
<pre>
  --disable-xcursor \
  --disable-xrender \
</pre>
<br>
For <b>FLTK 1.3.5</b> and <b>FLTK 1.4.x</b> the instructions above can be summarized as follows:<br>
<br>
a) run configure with the following script:
<pre>
./configure --disable-gl \
  --disable-xinerama \
  --disable-xft  \
  --disable-xdbe \
  --disable-xfixes \
  --enable-localjpeg \
  --enable-localpng \
  --enable-localzlib \
  --disable-threads \
  --x-includes=/path/to/microwindows/src/nx11/X11-local/X11 \
  --x-libraries=/path/to/microwindows/src/lib \
  --disable-xcursor \
  --disable-xrender 
</pre>
Modify the paths specified to match your situation.<br>
<br>
b) copy the file src/nx11/replace-lX11.sh into the fltk-1.4.x directory and run:
<pre>
./replace-lX11.sh makeinclude
./replace-lX11.sh fltk-config
</pre>
c) Change the following lines at the very end of the config.h file in the fltk directory:<br>
<pre>
#define HAVE_DLFCN_H 0
#define HAVE_DLSYM 0
</pre>
d) run "make" in the fltk directory now.<br>
For this to work make sure you did a "make install" in the "microwindows/src" directory before.<br>
<br>
e) execute the examples e.g. like this: "nano-X & test/editor"<br>
<br>
Additional details regarding FLTK on Microwindows are provided by Ian MacArthur here:  
<a href="http://www.fltk.org/articles.php?L1352+I60+T+P1+Q">Article #1352</a><br>
This article now refers to an earlier version of Microwindows and thus is partially deprecated now. The NX11 library<br>
does not need to be compiled separately any more and you do not need to remove VNC or patch the image_png.c<br>
and Text16.c files.<br>
<br>
There is also flnx which is a modified version of FLTK 1.1 to work with nano-X before<br>
NX11 was availabe. Flnx is deprecated now.<br>
<br>
</p>


<h3>How to use Microwindows and FLTK on the Android platform?</h3>

<p>There is a separate application note in this directory for Android.<br>
<br>
</p>


<h3>My application does not use truetype fonts! It uses just a small fixed font.</h3>

<p>This means Microwindows has not found any truetype fonts on your platform und uses the default<br>
system font.<br>
<br>
Microwindows comes with a fonts directory which contains a number of fonts. You can copy that<br>
into your application directory where your application then will usually find them.<br>
Nano-X uses the path "fonts/truetype" as default.<br>
<br>
NX11 will also scan the /usr/share/fonts directory for available fonts.<br>
<br>
If your application requests fonts that are not available, you can set up a fonts.alias file<br>
which will map the requested fonts to other fonts that are availabe. For DOS this file is<br>
called fonts.ali. You can also use a fonts.alias file if you only want to provide just a few fonts<br>
with your application to reduce the disk space required.<br>
<br>
Finally you can specify the path to the truetype fonts on your system by setting the global<br>
variable "TTFONTDIR" to this path. This variable is read by nano-X when searching for the truetype font.<br>
<br>
</p>

<h3>How do you use Microwindows with emscripten?</h3>
<p>Emscripten allows to compile a Microwindows application to Javascript and execute it<br>
in a tab of Firefox or some other browser. The Microwindows implementation is based on<br>
the SDL2 drivers.<br>
<br>
First download and install the emscripten package using the instructions from this page: <br>
<a href="https://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/docs/getting_started/downloads.html">Download and install</a><br>
This are currently the following commands on the command line of a Linux terminal window which will download<br>
about 400 MB of SDK tools.<br>
<pre>
git clone https://github.com/juj/emsdk.git
cd emsdk
git pull
./emsdk install latest
./emsdk activate latest
source ./emsdk_env.sh
</pre>
Within your "emsdk" directory enter "source ./emsdk_env.sh" to set the required paths for<br>
emscripten. <br>
<br>
To compile emscripten get into the "microwindows/src" directory and enter:<br>
"./make-emscripten" on the command line. This will compile most of the<br>
Microwindows system including the demos for emscripten.<br>
<br>
You can then run the demos using "./emrun demo-aafont", or with a click on e.g. the "bin/arcdemo.html" file or the <br>
"nxlib/test/xgreen.html" file using your file explorer. Your browser will load and run<br>
the application then. If the program terminates, emscripten will raise an exception to<br>
stop the Javascript code in the browser to continue. This causes an "Exception thrown" message<br>
displayed in the browser.<br>
<br>
To execute "make clean" enter: "./make-emscripten clean"<br>
<br>
Emscripten provides ports of libsdl2, libz, libpng, libfreetype, libm and more. If you compile your applications,<br>
these have to be added with the "-s" parameter to the command line, e.g. "-s USE_FREETYPE=1". Then -lfreetype <br>
should not be added in addition to that via the CLIBS variable.<br>
A Javascript program cannot access local files. Therefore emscripten allows to load these into its<br>
virtual file system. The parameter "--preload-file $(MW_DIR_SRC)/fonts/em-fonts@/usr/share/fonts/truetype"<br>
will load the directory "src/fonts/em-fonts" and its files at location "/usr/share/fonts/truetype" into<br>
the virtual file system to be used with freetype.<br>

<h3>How to compile on Windows with MinGW?</h3>

<p>The MinGW port is based on the Allegro graphics library and the Makefile_nr file. You can<br>
edit this file to use either Allegro4 or Allegro5. Depending on the Allegro library you specify<br>
for linking it will be linked statically or as a shared library. If you link with a shared<br>
library you have to distribute the corresponding Allegro dll with your application.<br>
<br>
Do not select png or jpeg in the Makefile_nr file since these are only used for the nano-X demos<br>
or other nano-X applications.<br>
<br>
So download a binary version of Allegro for MinGW or compile Allegro with MinGW.<br>
<br>
Run "make -f Makefile_nr" to compile Microwindows for MinGW.<br>
<br>
</p>

<h3>How to use Allegro5 on a Linux platform?</h3>

<p>There is an Allegro macro defined in the config file. If you set that the Allegro drivers<br>
are compiled in and the Allegro library is linked with nano-X. Currently only Allegro5 does work<br> 
with Nano-X applications, NX11/FLTK does not work. Allegro4 does not yet work on Linux.<br>
<br></p>

<h3>How to use SDL as a Microwindows backend?</h3>

<p>There are SDL macros defined in the config file. Use "src/Config/config.sdl"
Then the SDL2 driver is compiled in and is linked with nano-X. <br>
</p>

<h3>How to compile for DOS?</h3>

<p>To use Microwindows on DOS you need to compile with DJGPP. Once you have that set up use the<br>
makedos.bat file to compile. This batch file calls "make -f Makefile_nr ARCH=DOS".<br>
<br>
</p>

<h3>How to port a Linux application to Microwindows?</h3>

<p>
Since the configure script of the new application will not find NX11, it will look for <br>
standard X11.<br>
<br>
However, after you run ./configure on your Linux system you can edit the resulting Makefile and <br>
replace in it the references to the "-lX11 and -lXext" libraries with "-lNX11 -lnano-X". Many applications will compile then.<br>
<br>
You can also use the <b>replace-lX11.sh script</b> in the src directory to replace "-lX11 and -lXext" in a<br>
Makefile or any other file for you. Enter the name of the makefile on the command line when executing<br>
this script and it will replace "-lX11" and -lXext" with "-lNX11 and remove "-lXext" in this file.<br>
<br>
You can also add "-e" as the second parameter. In this case "-lXext" will be replaced with "-lNXext".<br>
"libNXext" is a library with stubs for the functions in the "libXext" library. You can use this if the<br>
application you want to port uses functions from the libXext library.<br>
<br>
The alternative is to modify the automake files so configure will generate a makefile that uses PXlib <br>
instead of Xlib and Xext.<br>
<br>
</p>

<h3>How to add new drivers to Microwindows?</h3>

<p>Follow e.g. the SDL example. Typically you will add a macro which selects the new drivers into the config file. <br>
Then set the library your drivers may need to link with in Makefile.rules and the drivers to compile with <br>
Microwindows in drivers/Objects.rules.<br>
<br>
Also check the files "nanox/srvmain" und "mwin/winmain". These contain #if / #elseif statements for <br>
different platforms which you will have to set for your platform too.<br>
<br></p>


<h3>Does Microwindows support GTK or QT?</h3>
<p>
This are applications which are too large to be ported to Microwindows.<br>
<br>
There is NanoGTK which is GTK version 1.2 ported to nano-X. With NX11 it is also possible to compile GTK1.<br>
However, today there are almost no applications using GTK1 since that is not compatible with GTK2.<br>
<br>
Greg Haerr did some tests with an early version of QT (qt-x11-2.3.1). The NX11 library was sufficiently<br>
binary compatible to run demos compiled with QT.
<br>
</p>

<h3>Should I use mwin or nano-X?</h3>
<p>In the early days of the Microwindows project there was a need for a GUI with widgets and dialogs.<br> 
It was decided to implement that as an Windows API compatible library called libmwin. So if you prefer<br> 
to code on the Windows API level you can use that. This library provides a Windows compatible API that<br>
can be used on any platfrom that Microwindows will run on.<br>
<br>
The Microwindows library therefore has two APIs: one is Windows API compatible (mwin) and one is<br>
X11 compatible (nano-X with NX11).<br>
<br>
With the current support for FLTK it is usually better to start an application based on that. FLTK is a<br>
more extensive GUI toolkit than the Windows API compatible mwin library.<br>
<br>
</p>

<h3>Can you use Windows resource files with the MWin API?</h3>
<p>Resource files describe the screen layout of a GUI when you are using Windows. The MWin API also supports<br>
resource files. The screen layout is developed using a screen designer and stored in a resource file. This file <br>
has the same name as the application program file but the ending is ".rc". Simple ".rc" files can also be written <br>
by hand. The ".rc" file is then compiled with a resource compiler to a ".res" file.<br>
<br>
If you use Dialog windows in your program, Microwindows will open a ".res" file with the same name as the program <br>
to load the screen layout to use. Microwindows uses a separate file while Windows adds this file to the program file itself. <br>
The demo programs, mwdialog and mwdvetest, put a logical link to their ".res" resource file into the "bin" directory.<br>
<br>
To write the a resource file and compile it you can use the ResourceHacker program on Windows. This program can <br>
also extract a ".rc" file from a ".res" file. On Linux there is a resource compiler called "windres".<br>
<br>
</p>

<h3>Can you use Java with Microwindows?</h3>
<p>
Greg Haerr got <a href="http://www.kaffe.org/">Kaffe</a> to work with Microwindows. This way you can run Java with Microwindows.<br>
<br>
</p>


<h3>How to use Microwindows with ELKS?</h3>
<p>
ELKS is 16bit version of Linux. The website is: <a href="http://elks.sourceforge.net/">http://elks.sourceforge.net/</a><br>
Due to memory constraints ELKS does support version 0.86 of Microwindows only. This has been reenabled in the year 2017 and added <br>
to the ELKS package. Details about this port are availabe at: https://github.com/jbruchon/elks/blob/master/nano-X/Readme-ELKS <br>
<br>
</p>


<h3>Why does printf not work?</h3>
<p>If you set DEBUG = Y in the config file, printf statements you add into the code will work. Otherwise<br>
Microwindows uses a #define macro to disable printf statements in the code.<br>
<br>
Microwindows uses the DPRINTF/EPRINTF macros in debug mode to print information to the console<br>
window. These are defined in the src/include/device.h header file.<br>
<br>
If the HAVE_FPRINTF macro, also defined in this header file, is set to 0 in e.g. Arch.rules, fprintf/printf <br>
will no longer work. <br>
<br>
</p>

<h3>My mouse wheel does not work!</h3>
<p>Nano-X and NX11 do support the mouse wheel, but not all mouse drivers in the drivers directory are adapted<br>
to report more than three mouse buttons yet. Currently only the gpm, x11 and Allegro mouse driver report the <br>
up- and down wheel movement.<br>
<br>
</p>

<h3>Why are there so many warnings in debug mode?</h3>
<p>The majority of the code was written over ten years ago and gcc constantly increased the number of warnings<br>
from release to release. In debug mode the code is compiled with the -Wall parameter plus requesting some<br>
additional warnings. This causes all these warnings with the old code base and it would take a very long<br>
time to remove all these now.<br>
<br>
In release mode the -Wall parameter is not set and Microwindows compiles with just a few warnings.<br>
<br>
</p>

<h3>Why does make fail if I use the '-j' or '--jobs' option?</h3>
<p> The Microwindows makefile is written as a recursive makefile and the main target cannot be run with this option.<br>
However, the subdirectories can be compiled with this option and this is done automatically using the number of<br>
processors in Make's $(nproc) variable if you set the PARALLEL option in the config file to "Y". This is the default now.<br>
<br>
You can set MICROWIN = N and MICROWINDEMO = N in the config file to reduce compile time if you will <br>
not use the MWin API and just use the X11 compatible API only. If you do not need the demo applications<br>
you can set NANOXDEMO = N too to avoid these demos to be compiled.<br>
<br></p>


<h3>What difference does the LINK_APP_INTO_SERVER macro make? - Linking options in config</h3>
<p>
Microwindows can be compiled to a separate server and the application linked with<br>
the nano-X.a library will have the client part that communicates via sockets with this server.<br>
So you first have to run nano-X before starting your application. A typical script for that<br>
looks like this: "bin/nano-X & bin/$progname".<br>
A script has been prewritten for you: src/runapp, usage: "./runapp progname".<br>
<br>
If you set the LINK_APP_INTO_SERVER macro to "Y" Microwindows will compile to a single nano-X.a library and not <br>
generate a separate nano-X server. The client and server parts <br>
are linked together to one library. If you link your application with this library, you do not have to <br>
load the server before the application, you can just click on the application in your file manager and that will <br>
start it. You can also start your application from the command line as a single program.<br>
<br>
The window manager will be included in the server only if you set the NANOWM variable to "Y". Otherwise the application will run<br>
without this window manager and thus without window decorations.<br>
<br>
If you set the SHAREDLIBS macro to "Y" the nano-X, NX11 etc. libraries are compiled as shared libries in<br>
addition to being compiled to static libaries. So the application does not have to link statically with nano-X<br> 
or NX11 but can load these dynamically at runtime. You find all these libraries in the "src/lib" directory.<br>
<br></p>


<h3>How can I uninstall the Microwindows files from the /usr directory?</h3>
<p>
There is the "cleanusr" target in the makefile for that. So "sudo make cleanusr" will remove the files from /usr/bin,<br>
/usr/lib and if availabe /usr/lib64.<br>
<br></p>


<h3>How can you enable two keyboards?</h3>
<p>
You can enable e.g. the soft keyboard as a second keyboard. For this set the "2NDKBD" parameter in the "config" file to "Y".<br>
This will cause the Makefile.rules file to set the macro "MW_FEATURE_TWO_KEYBOARDS" to one and the "pipe_kbd.c" driver will<br>
be compiled. This driver uses a named pipe. You also have to set the LINK_APP_INTO_SERVER macro to "N". The soft keyboard example<br>
in the "demos/nxkbd" directory will use the "pipe_kbd" driver. The nxkbd example is always compiled by the Makefile as part of<br>
the demos.<br>
<br>
To test the soft keyboard as the second keyboard you can execute the "nxkbd.sh" file in the "src/demoscripts" directory. This will<br>
load both the soft keyboard and the "grabdemo" program. You can then click the keys on the soft keyboard which will be displayed in<br>
the grabdemo program or type keys on your standard keyboard, the keys from both keyboards will be displayed.<br>
<br>
In general the macro "MW_FEATURE_TWO_KEYBOARDS" has to be set to one and you have to set the parameter "KBDDEVICE kbddev2"<br> 
in the keyboard driver you want to use as the second keyboard. In the "pipe_kbd.c" program the "MW_FEATURE_TWO_KEYBOARDS" macro<br> 
selects whether the driver uses "kbddev" for the first and often only keyboard or or "kbdev2" for the second keyboard.<br>
<br>
If you change the "KBDPIPE" macro in the "demos/nxkbd/srvconn.c" program to zero, it will not use the "pipe_kbd.c" driver but the<br>
"GrInjectKeyboardEvent()" function of the Nano-X API to write the keyclick and keyrelease of the soft keyboard into the standard<br>
event queue. Then you do not have to use the "MW_FEATURE_TWO_KEYBOARDS" macro.<br>
<br></p>

<h3>How to use the frame buffer emulator?</h3>
<p>
The frame buffer emulator is an X11 program that emulates a frame buffer using Xlib. This allows to test frame buffer programs while<br>
an X11 based desktop is loaded.<br>
<br>
If you set FBEMULATOR=Y in the "src/config" file, the frame buffer emulator code in "src/demos/fbe.c" will be compiled. To get<br>
Microwindows to use the frame buffer for screen output select FRAMEBUFFER=Y in the "src/config" file too. If you set FRAMEBUFFER=Y<br>
Microwindows will compile and use the framebuffer screen driver in "drivers/scr_fb.c". In this code you have to set the desired<br>
x/y resolution and color depth (bpp) which you plan to use. Set SCREEN_PIXTYPE=MWPF_TRUECOLORABGR in the "src/config" file for<br>
32 bpp which we will use below. For initial testing select the NOMOUSE and NOKBD drivers.<br>
<br>
To run the frame buffer emulator set the environment variable FRAMEBUFFER to: "FRAMEBUFFER=/tmp/fb0". The frame buffer driver<br>
Microwindows is using reads this environment variable on startup.<br>
<br>
Then execute the frame buffer emulator: "bin/fbe -d32&". The emulator will then run in the background. After that you can run your<br>
Nano-X or Microwindows program which will use the frame buffer screen driver on the X11 desktop. To use a mouse and a keyboard you<br>
also need to select drivers for these in the "src/config" file and unselect the NOMOUSE and NOKBD drivers in the config.fbe file.<br> 
The SERMOUSE and TTYKBD drivers should work. However, you have to allow read access to "dev/psaux" for the mouse and "dev/tty" for<br>
the keyboard. Otherwise you get "error 13". So enter "sudo chmod 666 /dev/psaux" and ""sudo chmod 666 /dev/tty" before running your<br>
application.<br>
<br>
The frame buffer emulator supports the following command line options:<br>
-x [X size], -y [Y Size], -t [Total X Size], -d [Color depths bpp(1,2,4,8,15,16,24,32)], -z [Zoom factor]<br>
-r [Reverse bit order (1,2,4bpp LSB first)], -g [Gray palette (4bpp only)], -c [Force create new framebuffer (required when size changes)] <br>
<br></p>

<h3>How to compile MuPDF with NX11?</h3>
<p>
Download MuPDF from this link: <a href="https://mupdf.com/downloads/archive/mupdf-1.14.0-source.tar.gz">https://mupdf.com/downloads/archive/mupdf-1.14.0-source.tar.gz</a><br>
After unpacking the archive into your home directory change the Makerules file in line 131 to use libNX11 instead of libX11 like this:<br>
<pre>
#X11_LIBS = $(shell pkg-config --libs x11 xext)
X11_LIBS = -L../lib -lNX11 -lnano-X
</pre>
Then compile MuPDF with the following command:<br>
<pre>make HAVE_GLUT=no</pre>
This will generate the executable file mupdf-x11 in the mupdf-1.14.0-source/build/release directory. To test we need a PDF document,<br>
so copy e.g. the file install.pdf into this build/release directory. This file will be erased each time you enter "make clean".<br>
<br>
Get into the build/release directory now and run mupdf-x11 with the following command to show the install.pdf file:<br>
<pre>
../../../microwindows/src/bin/nano-X -N & ./mupdf-x11 install.pdf
</pre>
This assumes that you put Microwindows into your home directory too and compiled it there. If you did a "make install"<br>
after compiling Microwindows, this command would be: "nano-X -N & ./mupdf-x11 install.pdf".
