The TinyWidgets web site is: http://tinywidgets.sourceforge.net/
/*------------------------------------------------------------------------*/

The TinyWidgets version in this directory is already configured, you just have to
enter 'make' to compile the package.

If compiling Microwindows using the default config file, you can run the
demos, e.g. progresstest, in the demos directory with this command line:
../../bin/nano-X & demos/progresstest

or the screen designer in the tndesigner directory with this command line:
../../bin/nano-X & tndesigner/tndesigner

Otherwise here are the steps if you want to run ./configure:

Configuring TinyWidgets: 

./configure

To specify a specific Microwindows directory, use the --with-microwin option:

./configure --with-microwin=/path_to/microwin/src

e.g. from this directory:
./configure --with-microwin=../..
 
Building TinyWidgets:
Run 'make' 

If you wish to compile individual stuff, use:
'make tnw' to make the TinyWidgets library.
'make demo' to make the demo programs.
'make tnd' to make the TinyWidgets Designer.

Installing TinyWidgets:
Run 'sudo make install'

This will copy the libtnW.a library, this is the TinyWidgets library, to
/usr/lib and therefore will require "sudo". On a 64bit system it should be
copied to /usr/lib64 depending on the distribution. The install target will 
also copy the TinyWidgets header files to /usr/include/microwin. This is the
location Microwindows copies its header files to.

To clean the object files and binaries:
run 'make clean'

To clean the entire distribution (including build system)
run 'make distclean'

Should you enter 'make distclean', the Makefiles are erased and you have to 
run ./configure as instructed above.
